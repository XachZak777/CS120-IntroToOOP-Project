<h1>Quarto Game</h1>

Welcome to Quarto Game, a Java implementation of the classic board game Quarto.

<h2>About</h2>

Quarto is a two-player abstract strategy game where players take turns placing pieces on a 4x4 board. The goal is to be the first to create a line of four pieces with a common attribute (color, shape, height, or fullness).

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for playing Quarto against another human player. It features intuitive controls, visual representation of game pieces, and win/draw detection.
